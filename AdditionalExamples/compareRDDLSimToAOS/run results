running RDDLSim: created_plps_instance on RDDLSim cam simulate 12,500 per second
to redo the experiment run (you will need to edit the runRddlSimExperiment.bash for jars in java pahs):
./runRddlSimExperiment.bash <path to current directory> created_plps_instance

for example:
./runRddlSimExperiment.bash ~/Projects/AOS-experiments/Additional Examples/compareRDDLSimToAOS created_plps_instance

or:
$ ./runRddlSimExperiment.bash $PWD created_plps_instance


running AOS: created_plps_instance domain as described in the createdPLPs folder was executed 452052 per second
to redo the experiment run:
./AOS-Solver/build/examples/cpp_models/plps_domain/despot_plps_domain
